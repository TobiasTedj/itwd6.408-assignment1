                      "Fair Use" does not apply within NZ. The term "Fair Use"
                      is an American term within an American Application. But NZ
                      does have a similar equivalent called "Fair Dealing",
                      however, it is more strict in terms of its definition and
                      application. Both deal with the use of copyrighted works
                      but while "Fair Use" can be quite vague and each case of
                      copyright infringement under the argument of "Fair Use"
                      must be examined on a case-by-case basis, "Fair Dealing"
                      is a stricter set of guidelines on what copyrighted
                      material can and cannot be used without the express
                      permission of the copyright holder.

                      SEO stands for Search Engine Optimisation. It describes
                      designs, implementations and techniques that improve your
                      websites visibility in search engine results e.g. where it
                      places on a Google search result page. Better SEO means
                      that search engines are able to more easily identify the
                      content in your website and what it has to offer. This is
                      extremely important when trying to grow your audience and
                      potential customers because when people search for a
                      topic, content, service etc. online, most people only take
                      into consideration the top few results on the result page.
                      Better SEO means search engines have a more accurate
                      understanding of your website and can relay that
                      information better to search engine users.
                    </p>
                    <p>5 ways to improve SEO:</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>
                        Organise your website: For example, make sure HTML tags
                        are being implemented correctly. When search engines
                        analyse your site, they use things like header tags to
                        determine the relevance and importance of content on
                        your site.
                      </li>

                        Keywords: Keep in mind what kind of search terms users
                        may input and use that as a basis for determining
                        keywords to include in your website. This will make your
                        website content more relevant to those you want to
                        target.

                        Optomise for mobile: Ensure your website is
                        mobile-responsive and offers a seamless user experience
                        on smartphones and tablets

                        Metadata: Webpages can contain metadata between the
                        &lt;head&gt; tags. Metadata carries information about
                        the contents of your page, such as title, description
                        etc. It is important this metadata is accurate for
                        search engines as this is also used to determine
                        relevancy of content.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Alt tags: Make sure any media on your website has alt
                        tags/alternative text descriptions. This is the short
                        description of the image or video on your webpage that
                        is used by search engines to determine what it is
                        actually showing, since they are unable to determine
                        what the image or video is without a description. When
                        users search for an image of something, search engines
                        know exactly what the images on your website is because
                        of the alt tag and can then show that to user if it is
                        relevant.

                      5 factors to consider when choosing a web hosting service:
                    </h5>
                    <ol>
                      <li>
                        Reliability and Uptime: Look for a provider with a good
                        record of stability, reliability and offers a high
                        uptime guarantee (>99%). This ensures that your website
                        will be available to visitors effectively at all times.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Speed: Look for a provider that offers good loading
                        speed. This not only improves user experience for
                        visitors, but relates back to SEO, as search engines
                        like Google prioritise faster loading websites.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Customer Support: Ensure that the provider has a good
                        customer support reputation. Look for things like 24/7
                        support and/or multiple contact channels (live chat,
                        phone, email). When something does go wrong with your
                        website, troubleshooting quickly is important to
                        minimise downtime as much as possible.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Scalability: Depending on your intentions for your
                        website, you may want to choose a provider that is able
                        to scale and grow with your needs in the future. Look
                        for a provider that can not only meet that growth
                        demand, but makes it easy to upgrade in the future.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Data Integrity and Security: Make sure the provider you
                        choose provides security features such as traffic
                        encryption between your website and visitors. Features
                        like a backup service is important for making sure that
                        recovery is possible in case of data loss or similar
                        issues.

                      5 things to do to improve website performance and reduce
                      page loading time:
                    </h5>
                    <ol>
                      <li>
                        Optimise images: Altering the format and dimensions of
                        images on your website can decrease their file size and
                        improve their load times.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Minimise HTTP requests: Every time a page loads up, it
                        needs to download components of that page (e.g. images,
                        stylesheets, scripts). Minimising the amount of things
                        you need to download will reduce your load times. For
                        example, where possible, you can combine stylesheets to
                        reduce the number of requests and downloads.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Use HTTP caching: Store static files such as Javascript
                        and CSS in the browsers cache so that they can load
                        recently visited websites faster.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Optimise JavaScript and CSS: JavaScript and CSS should
                        be stored in external files so they can be stored in the
                        cache for faster loading. Also ensure that you take
                        advantage of asynchronous loading. JS and CSS files can
                        load asynchronously, meaning that while your website
                        makes a request for files, it won't have to wait for the
                        reply before moving on and doing the next thing it needs
                        to do. It will be able to load multiple files at the
                        same time, speeding up the page's performance.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Limit the use of external scripts: Every time a page
                        loads, any scripted webpage elements from and external
                        source need to be loaded as well. Depending on the size,
                        these can slow a webpage down.
                      </li>

                    <h5>5 things to do for web maintenance:</h5>

                      <li>
                        Backups: Make regular backups of your website. Make your
                        own backps on top of any backup service provided by the
                        web host provider.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Keep your website updated: Make sure content on your
                        website is always as relevant and up-to-date as
                        possible. This helps with SEO and encourages visitors to
                        return and use your website.

                      <li>
                        Maintain links: If you have any links on your website to
                        third parties/external services, make sure they still
                        work after setting it up. Links can go dead for various
                        reasons so regular check that they all still work as
                        intended.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Test browser compatibility: Browsers are constantly
                        being updated with new standards and features. Regularly
                        check your website is still compatible with as many
                        different browsers and browser versions as possible.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Review analytics and statistics: Keep track of your
                        websites performance and traffic to gain insight on how
                        your website is performing and if there are any areas
                        you can improve on.

                        Malware: Malware is any code or programme designed to
                        damage or control a computer system. There are many
                        forms of malware such as ransomware, spyware and
                        trojans. These are all designed to harm your system,
                        whether that's restricting functionality or stealing
                        data.

                        Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks: A DoS attack is a
                        targeted attack that inundates a server or network with
                        an extremely large amount of requests, overwhelming the
                        system. As the system tries to handle the number of
                        requests, resources are entirely used up and real
                        requests become impossible to resolve, disrupting
                        operations. This costs businesses time and money to
                        resolve. A Distributed Denial-of-Service attack (DDoS)
                        is the same as DoS attack but instead of the fake
                        requests coming from one source, the system is attacked
                        from multiple sources. This makes it harder to resolve
                        the attack as multiple sources need to be blocked for
                        normal operations to resume.

                        Phishing: Phishing is a cyber attack that tries to trick
                        victims into downloading malware or sharing sensitive
                        information such as log in credentials, account numbers
                        etc. There are many types of phishing scams, but most
                        commonly the phisher will pose as person or entity such
                        as a bank or postal company and contact the victim via
                        email, sms, phone etc. They will ask them to click on a
                        link to "reset their password", download an "important
                        file" or "claim a missing package", all of which could
                        ultimately lead the victim into mistakenly downloading a
                        virus or share sensitive information.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Spoofing: Similar to phishing, this cyber attack
                        involves a malicious party posing as someone the victim
                        knows to lull them into a false sense of security. They
                        can pose as coworkers, friends or family members. The
                        attacker will try and get the victim to divulge
                        sensitive information, send them money or give them
                        access to the victims devices remotely.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Code injection attacks: Attackers will try to inject
                        malicious code into vulnerable systems and applications
                        to alter its behaviour and functionality. For example,
                        an SQL injection takes advantage of system
                        vulnerabilities to inject SQL statemnets into the system
                        to try and compromise the systems database. This can
                        result in altered, lost or stolen information.
